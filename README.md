# Chaplin

A Vue.js project for the Chaplin cinema in Montmelian city!
The previous website was old and I wanted to give it a refreshing look and more features.
Here is how it looked like: http://www.montmeliancine.free.fr/


## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run all tests
npm test
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
